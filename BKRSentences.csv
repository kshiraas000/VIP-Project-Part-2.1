There's little doubt that smartphone sales are slowing, which will put a dent in the iPhone's future growth prospects."
1,"Worldwide smartphone shipments fell by more than 4% in 2018, but appeared to turn the corner in 2019, producing annual growth of 1% according to market intelligence company Canalys."
1,"At the same time, Apple chipped away at its rivals, with its market share growing to 21.3% in the 2019 fourth quarter, up from 19.7% in the prior-year quarter, according to the report."

Apple CEO Tim Cook had famously predicted the company would double its 2016 services revenue by the end of 2020, a goal the company will likely achieve ahead of schedule."

For all its future growth prospects, it would be reasonable to assume Apple stock would fetch a premium valuation, but that's simply not the case."

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett began accumulating Apple shares in early 2016, a position started by either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, his most trusted investment managers."
1,"The purchase piqued Buffett's interest, and after researching the investment himself, the famed investor bought a massive stake, spending an estimated $36 billion on Apple shares."
1,"Even though the company has since reduced its holdings in Apple, its remaining stake still amounts to 245.2 million shares, worth more than $71 billion at current prices, and accounts for about 14% of Berkshire's market cap."
1,"Buffett has cited Apple's leadership, its customer loyalty, and the stickiness of its ecosystem as reasons for his size of his stake."

1,"A word of caution
It's important to note that with the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus, Apple shares initially took a beating, before regaining some of their losses."
1,With the bulk of its manufacturing and its second-largest consumer market in China -- the country currently hardest hit by the health crisis -- there will no doubt be a short-term disruption to Apple's business and its stock price will continue to be volatile until the outbreak has run its course.
1,"That said, with all the things working in its favor, investors should ignore the headlines and buy Apple stock."

2,"Regardless of how long you've been investing, the pace of change on Wall Street is something to marvel at."
2,"In 2021, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) were regularly notching off new all-time closing highs."
2,"Just one year later, in 2022, all three indexes were mired in a bear market and delivering their worst full-year returns since the global financial crisis."
2,"This year, the script has flipped, once more."
2,"Though the Dow, which outperformed the two other major stock indexes in 2022, is effectively flat on a year-to-date basis, through May 29, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have surged 9.5% and 24%, respectively."
2,"It would seem the bulls are, once again, running wild -- but looks can be deceiving."

2,"Breadth for Wall Street's benchmark stock index is potentially worrisome
For months, I've looked at a broad assortment of stock market indicators, financial metrics, and valuation tools to offer insight as to where stocks may head next."
2,"Even though there's no such thing as a foolproof indicator, history has a way of repeating itself on Wall Street, and these indicators and metrics have the potential to give investors who follow them a leg up."
2,"With the S&P 500 hitting a nine-month high this past week, it would appear the worst of the 2022 bear market is over."
2,"However, a closer look at the breadth within the S&P 500 reveals a different story."
2,"During a true bull market, we typically see a wide assortment of stocks take part in the upside."
2,"This means large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks from most sectors and industries are going to be rallying."
2,"But as you can see in the tweet below from Michael Kantro, the Chief Marketing Strategist at Piper Sandler, the S&P 500 seems to have a clear breadth problem."
2,"Lowest number of S&P 500 stocks beating the ""market"" $SPY since March 2000."
2,"pic.twitter.com/QXpwnPzQ1j
-- Kantro (@MichaelKantro) May 25, 2023
Based on recent data, approximately 20% of the S&P 500's components are beating the index on a trailing-three-month basis."
2,The last time such a small percentage of S&P 500 stocks were outperforming the broad-based index was March 2000.
2,"Not coincidentally, the S&P 500's closing high prior to the dot-com bubble bursting was set on March 24, 2000."
2,"Since the S&P 500 is a market-cap-weighted index, bigger businesses are going to have more influence."
2,"The nine largest components of the S&P 500 (including companies with multiple stock classes) are:
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 7.39% weighting
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 6.97% weighting
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 2.95% weighting
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 2.68% weighting
Alphabet Class A shares (NASDAQ: GOOGL): 2.11% weighting
Alphabet Class C shares (NASDAQ: GOOG): 1.86% weighting
Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (NYSE: BRK.B): 1.65% weighting
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): 1.62% weighting
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 1.43% weighting
Collectively, 28.66% of the point movements in the S&P 500 are being determined by just eight brand-name businesses."
2,"Keeping in mind that the S&P 500 is up by 9.5% year to date, here's how the index's largest components have fared since the start of 2023:
AAPL data by YCharts."
2,"With the exception of Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares, the other growth-focused companies listed above have been off to the races since 2023 began."
2,"Nvidia has been powered by artificial intelligence (AI) euphoria and is up 167%, while investors have flocked to the social media dominance offered by Meta, whose stock has also more than doubled."
2,"Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet's two classes of shares, Microsoft, and Apple aren't slouches, either, and have handily outperformed the benchmark index."
2,"While having a small number of stocks lead the market higher isn't, in itself, a telltale sign of bad things to come for Wall Street, history suggests it's generally not good news when a small group of stocks is leading while the majority of publicly traded companies are lagging."
2,It paints a picture of strength that masks broad-based market weakness.
2,"Market breadth is meaningless if you use time as an ally
Although the S&P 500 displaying an ominous breadth warning not seen in 23 years may represent a coming top in the broad-based index, this isn't something to worry about if you're an investor with a long-term mindset."
2,"To be fair, the dot-com bubble top in 2000 and bear market that followed weren't pleasant."
2,"The S&P 500 shed nearly half of its value over more than two years, and the Nasdaq Composite was hit even harder."
2,"But like every other stock market crash, correction, and bear market that came before it, index-based declines tied to the dot-com bubble were eventually put behind us."
2,"In fact, with the exception of the current bear market, every single double-digit percentage decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite has eventually been wiped away by a bull market."
2,Image source: Getty Images.
2,"To add to the above, no indicator has been a greater ally to investors over the past century than time."
2,"Market analytics company Crestmont Research examined the effects of time on investors by tabulating the total returns, including dividends, an investor would have netted if they'd purchased an S&P 500 tracking index and held that position for 20 years."
2,"Crestmont backdated its analysis to 1900, which gave it 104 years of rolling 20-year return data (1919 through 2022) to sift through."
2,Here's the kicker: All 104 rolling 20-year periods produced a positive total return.
2,"In other words, it literally didn't matter when you bought into an S&P 500 tracking index since 1900."
2,"As long as you held that position for 20 years, you generated a positive total return."
2,But that's not all.
2,"Whereas a small number of ending years led to an annualized total return of between 3% and 5%, more than half of these 104 ending years led to an annualized return over 20 years of between 9% and 17.1%."
2,"These are the sort of returns that can build serious wealth and trump other asset classes, such as bonds, housing, and commodities."
2,Timing the market in the short term can be a crapshoot.
2,But time in the market over the long run is a proven wealth-building strategy.
2,"Even if poor S&P 500 market breadth serves as a warning of a possible near-term top in the major indexes, it's nothing that should concern investors who are using time as their ally."

3,Cathie Wood went from the hottest investing guru around to cold fish in just a year.
3,"Her Ark Invest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) doubled investors' money in 2020, but subsequently collapsed when the tech stock bull market came to a screeching halt."
3,"However, Wood's Ark Innovation ETF is running strong again in 2023, up over 23% since the start of the year compared to a 1.5% decline in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)."
3,"Warren Buffett, of course, has an enviable 60-year track record under his belt and has generated returns of 3,600,000% in that time frame (yes, you read that right -- 3.6 million percent returns)."
3,Image source: The Motley Fool.
3,"The investing styles of Wood and Buffett could hardly be more different, though."
3,"Whereas the Oracle of Omaha generally sticks to a buy-and-hold philosophy, Wood trades much more frenetically as she's not opposed to jumping into and out of positions frequently, sometimes on a daily basis."
3,"For all her trading and the collapse of the tech sector, Wood is still a sharp Wall Street guru who has 10-year annual returns of over 85%, indicating how well she did during the former bull market."
3,"Do you prefer Buffett's more laid-back, big-bet style on solid businesses or Wood's in-and-out pace trying to capture a stock's trend?"
3,Let's take a look at the stock each of the investing gurus has made their biggest bet on.
3,"Apple
For an investor who famously swore off tech stocks because he didn't understand them, Buffett has tightly embraced Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock, making it his biggest holding by far."
3,"The consumer gadget maker comprises 41% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, some $136 billion in total."
3,"No doubt Buffett likes the fact that this iconic brand commands the loyalty of tens of millions of consumers willing to pay a premium for its products, as well as being an innovative tech stock."
3,"Arguably its greatest product is the iPhone, which generates 85% of Cupertino's operating profits and 48% of its revenue."
3,"Yet it has a strong presence across many gadgets, including computers and wearables."
3,"The Apple Watch has more than twice the market share of its nearest rival, for example."
3,"The tech giant now has an installed base of more than 2 billion active devices, or double what it was seven years ago."
3,"Where Apple will likely be seeing future growth, however, is in services."
3,"The segment just achieved record revenue this past quarter, hitting $20.8 billion, or almost 18% of total sales."
3,"Margins for the services business are also generous, representing around 70% of revenue."
3,"Although Wall Street seems to write off Apple every time there's a bump in the road, there may be a lot more success ahead for this growth-oriented tech stock."
3,Image source: Tesla.
3,"Tesla
Wood seems to have a love-hate relationship with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as she is forever buying and selling the stock."
3,"Even so, it is the largest holding across her ETFs, representing almost 7.9% of the total."
3,"At last count, she owned over 5 million shares, making it a billion-dollar holding for her funds."
3,"Yet, her holdings seem to track the rise and fall in the electric car stock itself, which not that long ago had a $1 trillion market valuation only to see it implode and lose over 60% of its value."
3,"It's marching higher once more as auto sales rose 35%, but questions remain about how sustainable that growth is."
3,"Tesla cut prices, which may help to juice sales further, but it will reduce revenue and profit margins in the process."
3,"The automaker maintains that gross margins, however, will still exceed 20%, which is better than its rivals."
3,"EVs will have a rough road ahead, no matter what."
3,"Challenges include dependence on tax credits to boost consumer demand; a shaky national electric grid that will only be stressed more as new EVs are sold; more manufacturers chasing finite resources, which will increase costs; and an increasingly competitive international marketplace."
3,"Tesla remains the leading EV maker by far, but analysts see Ford and General Motors surpassing it sooner rather than later."
3,"It still has a place in the market, but growth may be lumpier and take longer to achieve than what investors hope."
3,Buffett or Wood?
3,Buying into Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway means its performance will be heavily swayed by how Apple's stock performs.
3,"Buffett's second top pick, Chevron, has just a 10% position in the portfolio and won't influence its returns nearly as much as Apple."
3,"While Tesla commands Wood's top spot, four more stocks are not far behind with around a 5% or so weighting in her portfolio."
3,No one company will unduly sway returns and it comes down to her stock-picking prowess.
3,Individual investors need to determine their own appetite for risk and decide whether they find themselves more on Team Buffett or Team Wood.

4,"What happened
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are reacting to an overnight report on how it it planning to ensure it has the raw materials to continue to lead the EV market as it grows."
4,The report has Tesla shares jumping in early trading.
4,"As of 11:03 a.m. ET, the stock was up 3.5%."
4,"So what
Tesla has plans to add another battery supplier, and it is one of the largest EV makers in China, according to CNBC."
4,"That supplier, Chinese automaker BYD, is also a company Warren Buffett likes."
4,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned 225 million shares of BYD as of Dec.
4,"31, 2021, representing a 7.7% ownership stake in the company."
4,"The report quoted BYD Vice President Lian Yubo as saying his company is ""now good friends"" with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and that BYD is ready to supply batteries to Tesla soon."
4,Image source: Tesla.
4,"Now what
BYD sold more than 740,000 electric and fossil-fuel-based vehicles combined last year."
4,"Its new-energy-vehicle production -- which includes both plug-in hybrid and battery electric cars -- more than tripled year over year in 2021, to more than 600,000."
4,"That makes it a direct competitor to Tesla, which also has a manufacturing plant in the largest global EV market."
4,"While vehicle production was a much larger portion of its sales, battery sales represented about 7.3% of total revenue in 2021."
4,"The alignment makes for an interesting combination, as its other battery suppliers are not competing directly with Tesla for vehicle sales."
4,"But Musk knows EV competition is heating up, and one of the supply chain restrictions could be battery supply in coming years."
4,Investors are cheering the news that Tesla is thinking ahead to be able to supply its growing manufacturing volume with a necessary part that might be in short supply for many EV makers.

5,"On Monday afternoon, universally recognized investor, chairman, and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B Warren Buffett issued a direct challenge to Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump."
5,"He wants Trump to meet with him, bring his tax returns, and let the public inquire about the filings."
5,"For some time now, Trump has resisted releasing his returns, citing that he is ""being audited by the IRS."" However, Buffett responded by stating that he too is being audited, and that it is not a reason to avoid disclosing his returns."
5,"For the last 40 years, every major party presidential candidate has released their tax returns, so it is fishy to some that Trump remains hesitant in doing so."
5,"The so-called ""Oracle of Omaha"" and the Donald have differing ideologies on quite a few things."
5,"Both also stand in different positions socially, as well as in terms of net worth, and influence, although some of these can be a bit subjective."
5,Let's break down just how unlike each other these two are.
5,"The Battle for Attention
For years now, Donald Trump has found some way to stay in the spotlight."
5,"With interviews spanning back to the 80s to his controversial show, The Apprentice , which he was on from 2004 until 2015, Trump has done much to stay relevant in the public domain."
5,"He has filmography spanning back to 1985, and as recently as 2015 hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live ."
5,"Trump also owned part or all of the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants, which has had its own share of controversy as well."
5,"In this regard, there is a stark difference between Trump and Buffett, who according to his biographer used to throw up before public speaking, and ""arranged my life so that I never had to get up in front of anybody.""
Given his recent speech introducing Hillary Clinton and calling out Trump on his taxes, we know Buffett is no longer the stranger to public speaking that he once was."
5,"Overall, Buffett has never done much to bring himself into the spotlight."
5,"Although making public appearances here and there, to speak about the market, endorse a candidate, or serve as an economic adviser, Buffett is not as hungry for attention as his counterpart."
5,"Path to Wealth
In 1975, Donald Trump inherited a real estate business from his father, Fred Trump."
5,"At the time of inheritance, the business was worth $40 million."
5,"He claims his current net worth to stand at around $10 billion, although there is some disagreement over that number."
5,"Between then and now, Trump has grown his business through building his brand name hotels and towers across different parts of the U.S. First, he concentrated entirely on New York, which was quite the gamble, but has since built properties on both coasts of the U.S. and in between, Canada, Panama, Mumbai, the Philippines, and other countries as well."
5,Trump has also concentrated on building his brand through his dedication to remaining in view of the public (as discussed above).
5,"The son of a Republican Congressman, Warren Buffett's life as an entrepreneur began quite early, when as a child he sold chewing gum, soda bottles, and weekly magazines door-to-door."
5,The world knows him for purchasing Berkshire Hathaway.
5,"He gained control of the company in 1964 as a textile business, which he soon cut and expanded into the insurance industry."
5,"In the years since, Berkshire Hathaway has acquired and holds stakes in many major companies."
5,"Much of Buffett's estimated $63.3 billion net worth comes from his holdings in Berkshire Hathaway, which manages a portfolio worth over $132 billion."
5,"His company has grown over 1.8 million percent since Buffett took over, yet another testament to his legendary reputation."
5,What Kind of Influence Do Each Have?
5,"On the topic of influence, both that of Trump and Buffett are massive in their own regard."
5,"Over the years, Buffett has been the subject of countless studies, books, and a shift in the way that many approach investing."
5,"His ""value investing"" methodology has gained many supporters, followers, and practitioners."
5,"Buffett has also pledged to donate 99% of his worth to charity, an impact that is currently immeasurable due to the vast amount of uses that money can have in the future."
5,"Furthermore, the market responds to Buffett's movements."
5,"When Buffett announces a stake in a company, its stocks soar, which goes to show how much people value his expertise."
5,Donald Trump has had a monstrous amount of influence as well.
5,"Between making his catchphrase ""you're fired"" resonate in households across the nation to now becoming the Republican presidential nominee, Trump has become quite well-known."
5,"The ethicality of his influence is not for me to comment on, but he has done much to bring disgruntled Americans out of the woodwork and onboard to support his message."
5,"Bottom Line
Warren Buffett and Donald Trump are very different people, in just about every way."
5,"Both have made names for themselves, are some of the wealthiest on Earth, and are influential enough to have articles written about them."
5,"One thing's for sure, and that is that both names will show up in history books, although under different pretenses."

It seems there are some traders who are getting a tad bit miffed at Mr. Buffett."
6,He didn’t go on a buying spree back in May.
6,But I think it’s time to follow some advice that would help in other aspects of life.
6,And that is sometimes people will honestly tell you exactly what their intentions are.
6,"In the case of Buffett, he’s told investors he isn’t buying because he doesn’t think there’s anything of value to buy."
6,And maybe he’s right.
6,The market has been full of FOMO this year.
6,Investors are lamenting the run-up in stock prices.
6,And many of those same investors are chasing anything that shows a smidge of movement.
6,Why Is Berkshire Hathaway Stock Underperforming?
6,"In my opinion, the underperformance of Berkshire Hathaway stock (at least this year) is due to Buffett simply sitting things out."
6,"7 Stocks to Buy to Finish 2020 With a Bang
“We have not done anything, because we don’t see anything that attractive to do,” the Oracle of Omaha quipped during the company’s May shareholder’s meeting."
6,"“Now that could change very quickly or it may not change.”
As traders frequently point out in chat rooms, Buffett is sitting on a pile of cash."
6,"At the end of the first quarter, the company had a record $137 billion in cash and equivalent instruments on the balance sheet."
6,But another reason why the stock may be underperforming is that five stocks make up over 75% of its holdings.
6,"Those stocks are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC)."
6,In fact Apple counts for almost half of Berkshire’s invested assets.
6,And how are these stocks performing?
6,"Apple – up 54%
Bank of America – down 33%
Coca-Cola – down 9.7%
American Express – down -18.5%
Kraft Heinz – flat
So I guess from that perspective investors might be glad Berkshire Hathaway stock is “only” down about 8% for the year (at the time of this writing)."
6,"Let the Buyer Beware
There is a saying about learning the lessons of history."
6,"In this case, investors of a certain age can remember the dot-com bubble."
6,"But many investors today, particularly the aggressive day traders and Robinhood traders were barely alive."
6,They certainly aren’t conditioned to believe that stocks don’t have a divine right to always move higher.
6,I’m not boldly calling for a bear market.
6,I am pointing out that many people were calling a bubble before the pandemic hit.
6,Yes the air came out of the market in March.
6,But that was overdone.
6,"And so, dare I say it, may be the melt up."
6,And maybe all Buffett is signaling is what he’s always signaled.
6,Buy companies for the long-term.
6,He’s certainly doing that.
6,And look for companies that are undervalued.
6,He’s apparently not seeing a lot of that.
6,Electric vehicle (EV) stocks are moving higher just because they have something to do with EVs. Some zombie stocks are being kept alive by investors who are taking a moonshot on rockets that have no fuel.
6,Buffett has famously said to buy when others are fearful.
6,But the opposite is also true.
6,"Buffett is not bearish on stocks, but seems to be making it clear, it’s time for caution."
6,That seems like good advice as we head into the rest of an already crazy year.
6,"So instead of wondering what’s wrong with Berkshire Hathaway stock, maybe it’s time to look at what’s right."

7,Snowflake's (NYSE: SNOW) expanding margins and impressive revenue retention make it a stock worth watching.
7,"In this clip from ""IPO & SPAC Show"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on April 11, Motley Fool contributor Danny Vena discusses the performance and financials of Snowflake, along with what differentiates the data warehousing company from competitors."
7,"{% sfr %}
Danny Vena: Now Snowflake, just leave the slide up here, what Snowflake does is they are a data warehouse."
7,"One of the things that they do is they allow enterprise customers to draw data from old enterprise systems, pull it into one place where they can actually then use that data to gain insights."
7,"Similar to what Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) does, but there's more of a storage capacity as well."
7,Now what differentiates Snowflake from some other companies is it's not technically a software-as-a-service business.
7,"SaaS businesses, we know that these companies use this software-as-a-service."
7,What's different about Snowflake is the fact that they are a use-based business.
7,Customers pay on an as-you-go basis for the time and the data that they use.
7,I think one of the biggest things that's working in Snowflake's favor is the digital transformation is ongoing and we are creating new data at a remarkable clip.
7,"The ability to not only store that data, warehouse that data, but also draw meaningful insights from that data is important."
7,The software doubled on its first day of trading.
7,Early investors were Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).
7,"Most recently, and this is key here, this is a year after their IPO, revenue still doubled year-over-year in the most recent quarter, and the company's margins are expanding."
7,"Now you look at remaining performance obligation, an important metric that Jason touched on earlier, which is revenue that's contractually obligated but hasn't been booked into revenue yet."
7,"That also doubled, which means that sometime over the course of the next year, they're going to book that into revenue, which bodes well for future growth."
7,The company also just said that the most recent quarter was their largest bookings quarter ever.
7,"They're still growing customers hand over fist and their most valuable customers are growing at three times the rate, almost four times the rate of their regular customer growth."
7,"Revenue retention is remarkable, customers spent 78% more this year than last year."
7,Their free cash flow went up by 10x.
7,This is a company that I find to be pretty fascinating overall.
7,"It's been able to keep up the level of growth that they did at the time of their IPO, which is not something that you've seen very much from other companies."

8,Investors from all walks of life idolize Warren Buffett for his stock-picking prowess.
8,"Buffett started investing in stocks when he was only 11, but he didn't become a billionaire until age 56, and there's been no looking back since."
8,Buffett's net worth right now is around $97 billion.
8,Buffett has shown how investing in stocks for the long term can generate life-changing wealth.
8,"His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns more than 50 stocks, most of which were first purchased several years ago."
8,"You too can build wealth if you start early, and buy and hold high-conviction stocks."
8,"Here are three such rock-solid Buffett stocks you can buy for as little as $1,000 and hold forever."
8,"This transformation should pay off
First up is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)."
8,"Buffett hasn't traded or spoken much about J&J over the years, but the fact that he first bought the healthcare stock almost 16 years ago and continues to own it bespeaks his conviction in the healthcare giant."
8,"The easiest argument in favor of J&J stock amid market volatility is its clout in healthcare, which also makes it an attractive defensive stock."
8,"To put that into context, J&J has handily outperformed the market this year, and for all we know, this could just be the beginning as J&J transforms itself."
8,J&J plans to spin off its consumer health business into a separate publicly traded company within the next 18 to 24 months.
8,"That will leave it with two high-potential, fast-growing segments -- pharmaceuticals and medical devices."
8,"In 2021, 52% of J&J's sales came from pharmaceuticals that include well-known drugs for complex diseases, while medical devices brought in 27% of its sales."
8,"The remaining sales came from consumer health which, despite including iconic brands like Neutrogena, Tylenol, and Listerine, is a cyclical business and has been a laggard on J&J's margins."
8,"While J&J works toward its transformation, you can sit back and enjoy a 2.5% yield backed by steady and growing dividends."
8,"Buffett loves dividends, and J&J is a Dividend King that has hiked dividends every year for 60 consecutive years."
8,"Buffett saw promise in this stock when no one else did
The second Buffet stock to buy -- and I've been pounding the table on this one for several months now -- is BYD (OTC: BYDDY)."
8,"The S&P 500 has shed almost 18% value so far this year, but BYD stock is up 19% so far."
8,There's a reason why BYD is outperforming the market.
8,"BYD has only recently caught Wall Street's attention, but Buffett spotted potential in the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer as early as 2008."
8,"Today, China is the world's largest EV market, and BYD is a leader in the industry."
8,"In fact, BYD sees so much potential in plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles that it stopped production of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in March."
8,"BYD's sales more than doubled in May, and it now reportedly has a backlog of nearly 600,000 units, according to local Chinese media outlets."
8,"Between January and May alone, BYD sold more than 500,000 vehicles, close to the number it sold in 2021."
8,"Aside from passenger cars, BYD also makes commercial vehicles, and even builds and sells them in the U.S. BYD is also one of the leading battery makers in China and has reportedly even struck a battery-supply deal with EV giant Tesla."
8,"Lithium is one of the hottest metals right now, so much so that BYD plans to buy several lithium mines in Africa to secure a long-term supply."
8,"BYD is doing everything right in an industry with exponential growth potential, making it a no-brainer Buffett stock to own."
8,"A no-brainer Buffett cash cow stock to buy
Visa (NYSE: V) is the third and one of the smartest Buffett stocks you could buy right now and own for as long as you possibly can."
8,Many expected Visa's growth to pause as consumers fall back on cash after relying on online purchases and digital payments over the past couple of years when the COVID-19 pandemic raged.
8,"However, digital payments continue to displace cash."
8,"Visa processed 7.9 billion more payments transactions across debit and credit cards but 16 million fewer cash transactions (including cash access, balance access, and balance transfer transactions) in its second quarter ended March 31."
8,"Remember, the war on cash isn't a fad but a secular trend that Visa, the industry leader, is perfectly poised to ride."
8,And here's something else that works in its favor: Visa is not a lender but only processes payments made using its co-branded cards in return for a fee.
8,Such a business model is not only asset-light but free from credit risks that most financial stocks typically face.
8,And it's huge: Visa processed payments and cash transactions worth $13 trillion in 2021 and had nearly 3.7 billion cards issued worldwide.
8,"It's no surprise, then, that owning shares of a cash cow with solid margins in a growing industry has turned out to be so lucrative for long-term investors."
8,"It should continue to be lucrative for those who buy this Buffett stock that's still down about 14% in the past one year and trading at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.39 times, considerably below its five-year average PEG."
