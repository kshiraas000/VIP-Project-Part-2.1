1723222.0,2023-12-16 00:00:00 UTC,Meta Platforms' Stock Hit a Nearly 2-Year High on Monday. Can It Keep Soaring?,PBR-A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-hit-a-nearly-2-year-high-on-monday.-can-it-keep-soaring,,,"Even the most bullish believers in a stock have to take a hard look at their investment when it rises to new heights. Now would be a good time to do so with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), as the social media giant's share price climbed to heights not seen since the holiday season of 2021. This was on the back of a good Monday for the stock, as it closed a meaty 2.9% higher over its previous trading session.
The AI revolution comes to social media
While Meta as a company has had its fits and stumbles this year, it's nevertheless continued to be an investor favorite. Its core asset Facebook is the property most readily associated with social media, even after years of dominance and more than a little competition for the throne.
Compounding that, Meta has plunged deeply into artificial intelligence (AI), the technology that powers quite a few features on Facebook and other company sites. Investors remain hungry and unsatisfied with the still-limited numbers of AI-heavy stocks on the market, so they continue to jump into titles associated with the technology. Meta has the distinct advantage of being both a familiar property and an active AI developer.
It's too early to determine which AI-infused companies are going to lead the market and enrapture the business world with their technology. At this stage, many feel that it's wisest to place bets on established tech players figuring out clever ways to enhance their business with AI. Meta definitely qualifies, and the market continues to reward it for being in this position.
A fine combination of established and new
Meta is already operating from a position of strength. It remains a primary destination for the type of valuable, granular advertising unavailable in most other media, and it has a massive user base.
Neither of these great advantages should melt away soon to any degree; add business-enhancing tech like AI into the mix, and you've got a company that can keep winning for years to come. This means no one should worry about Meta's rising stock price.

1989326.0,2017-07-17 00:00:00 UTC,Facebook Inc (FB) Stock’s Growth Will Be Rooted in Instagram,SNAP,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/facebook-inc-fb-stocks-growth-will-be-rooted-in-instagram-2017-07-17,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ) may have won the market's attention in recent months since its IPO but investors looking for value in technology stock should watch Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ) instead.
Source: Shutterstock
New features in its Instagram app are driving usage. That development is troubling for Snap and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), which is struggling to keep its relevance.
Instagram Grows for Facebook
Instagram Stories now has 250 million daily users . Nearly a year after adding the Stories feature, usage is growing sharply. Facebook will invariably benefit from the strong numbers. It could even take Snap and Twitter customers away, thanks to the strong traffic numbers.
Still, advertisers may want more details on the user activity. Are the daily users posting stories or just viewing posts? Where do most users reside, geographically? Snap's biggest demographic is the North American market. That makes each user count of higher value there compared to other social networking sites.
FB stock may shed some positive light on its Instagram growth when it reports quarterly results on July 26 . Of the 36 analysts polled, the company is expected to earn $1.12 per share in the second quarter, up from 97 cents a share last year. The $9.19 billion revenue estimate implies sales will grow 42.8%.
The 10 Safest Blue-Chip Dividends on Wall Street
In the last quarter, management issued light expectations . It said that ad blockers on the desktop would hurt ad revenue. Full-year GAAP expenses will rise by between 40% and 50%. Facebook is already experiencing a slowdown in growth in the U.S. and in Canada. Growth from the rest of the world moderated the impact of the weakness.
Fortunately, Facebook will offset the second-half weakness in ads by partnering with studios and sports teams to bolster video content. Not only will users stay online longer, but the video content will get more engaged on the site. Since video is the newer, less developed type of content on the social networking site, Facebook is separating it on another tab, away from the News Feed.
Until the company figures out how to balance revenue sharing, the company will not overwhelm the user with video.
FB Stock Gets an Upgrade
Ahead of the earnings report, Credit Suisse upgraded FB stock on Jul. 10, to $220 a share . The analyst cited better ad pricing and a moderating in an impression slowdown for the optimism. At a market capitalization of $463 billion, low short float and around $11 a share in cash, Facebook may even accelerate its growth rate by making a bold acquisition.
Its acquisition of WhatsApp proved a good move: this app, along with Facebook Messenger, each have 1.2 billion users. Had Facebook.com started losing users, they very likely would have migrated to one of several chatting apps, including WhatsApp.
FB stock could make its next acquisition in the gaming market. Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA ) is expensive, with a $34 billion market cap, but the gaming customer could complement Facebook's site or accelerate Oculus VR development. To spur sales, Facebook temporarily cut prices of the Rift VR headset and Touch controller to just $399 . The regular price has also been lowered to $499 .

The $399 price for the bundle will last for next six weeks. Markets might believe the unit is facing weak sales, but cheaper component pricing is one of the reasons for making the price adjustment. The platform also has enough games and movies to rationalize the promotion.
Takeaway
Facebook's strong growth trajectory will face some bumps along the way as online advertising demand makes its seasonal shift. The company continues to invest in the core business during the slow summer period. This investment will pay off: Instagram Stories and WhatsApp continue to grow in popularity. At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 26 times, shareholders just need to hold the stock for the long term.
As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1162045.0,2022-11-03 00:00:00 UTC,"Meta Platforms Stock Lost 28% In One Week, What's Next?",GOOG,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-lost-28-in-one-week-whats-next,,,"Meta Platforms’ stock (NASDAQ: META) has lost 28% in the last week, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (up 1.9%). Further, the same trend was observed over the last ten days (-30% vs -5.3%) and one month period (-31% vs 8.1%). 
The social media giant missed the consensus estimates in the third quarter of 2022, the second quarter in a row. It reported a 4% decline in net revenues to $27.7 billion, mainly due to a 4% drop in advertising revenues. While the key metrics like family daily active people (DAP) and Facebook daily active users (DAUs) increased by 4% and 3% respectively, average price-per-ad decreased by 18% y-o-y. The advertising revenues primarily suffered because of online advertisement budgets cuts due to a tough macroeconomic scenario and higher competition from rivals. Further, the firm provided revenue guidance of $30-$32.5 billion for Q4, which is lower than the year-ago period. On the cost front, the company’s operating margin decreased from 36% to 20% in the quarter due to higher research & development and general & administrative expenses. Overall, the weak Q3 results were the main reason behind the negative stock movement.

311578.0,2023-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,Meta Platforms: The Bull and Bear Case for META Stock,BCDAW,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-platforms%3A-the-bull-and-bear-case-for-meta-stock,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has seen a more-than 170% this year. With a focus on social media profitability and AI integration, this stock has gained momentum. Consumers and investors responded positively to the company’s introduction of the Quest 3 VR headset, generative AI chatbots, and updated Ray-Ban smart glasses. 
The company reported strong results and has done so in past quarters. In Q3, Meta reported a robust 23% revenue growth, marking its fastest pace in two years, driven by the recovering online ads market.While the company has been having excellent financials and growth, the bears are still finding some loopholes that can drag the stock down. Let’s delve into the bear and bull case for META.
The Bull Case
Meta Platforms’ stock surged 181% in 2023, reaching a $868 billion market cap. Another 15% jump would propel it to the $1 trillion mark. Meta’s revenue increased 12% YoY to $94.8 billion in the first nine months of 2023.
If Meta hits $168 billion in 2025 revenue and maintains a five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 7.5, it could reach a $1.26 trillion market cap in three years. This potential is driven by the digital ad market’s anticipated growth to $1.26 trillion by 2032, with Meta holding a 23% share based on 2022 estimates.
Sustaining rapid growth, Meta’s expanding user base, reaching nearly 4 billion monthly active users in Q3, aligns with the digital ad market. With AI tools enhancing ad effectiveness, Meta’s potential to surpass $1 trillion valuation is evident, foreshadowing substantial growth.
The Bear Case
On the bearish side, Meta Platforms currently faces allegations for its ad-free subscription in Europe. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and 18 affiliates lodged a complaint alleging it violates EU consumer laws. This follows NOYB’s privacy complaint to the Austrian watchdog, equating the service to privacy payment.
Meta introduced a paid ad-free subscription for Facebook and Instagram, aiming to align with EU regulations on user data choice. BEUC accused Meta of violating EU consumer laws through unfair practices, including pressuring users and providing inadequate information, according to BEUC Deputy Director General Ursula Pachl.
This puts Meta Platforms in a bit of a bad shade, but investors believe this will just affect in the short-term.
The Verdict
Despite legal challenges, both bullish and bearish arguments exist for Meta Platforms. The company faces litigation, yet long-term market cap growth is expected. The ongoing tug-of-war between bulls and bears adds complexity to this outlook.
Choose your stance now. If bullish, holding META stock through at least the end of 2023 is recommended. While challenges persist, Meta Platforms is expected to endure and sustain robust revenue in the foreseeable future.

Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Facebook, Inc. Quote
Security Initiatives Getting More Focus
CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Facebook is taking help from experts to decide acceptability of content. The company is currently in the process of building an independent body that will hear people's appeal over Facebook's content decisions.
Facebook is also working on making its products and services end-to-end encrypted and ephemeral, so that user information will not be available for long.
Instagram, Watch & More
Facebook stated that Instagram has more than 500 million daily active users on Stories. Management expects to introduce ecommerce and shopping on Instagram. Notably, more than 90 million small businesses now use Facebook's products.
Moreover, 400 million people use Watch every month. On average, people spend more than 20 minutes on Watch daily.
Facebook also reiterated its focus on messaging, which is growing rapidly. The company plans to roll-out payments on WhatsApp in some more countries.
Further, Facebook is heavily investing in augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) as well as hardware to foster more community feeling and social interactions. The launch of hardware products like Portal and Oculus Quest are steps toward that direction.
Ad Revenue Details
Mobile ad revenues surged 36% year over year to $15.5 billion, contributing 93% to total ad revenues. Ad impressions served increased 34%, while average price per ad decreased 2% from the year-ago quarter.
Impressions growth was driven by higher Feed & Stories ads on Instagram and Facebook mobile News Feed. However, year-over-year decline in average price per ad reflects unfavorable mix shift toward Stories, which is a low monetized product.
Facebook stated that it has more than 7 million active advertisers across its services. Moreover, 2 million advertisers are using Stories to reach customers across the company's family of apps.
In the reported quarter, Facebook expanded Automatic Placements, which converts feed ads into a format that works for Stories and delivers ads wherever they will get the best results.
Facebook also launched ads in Messenger Stories. This means advertisers can now easily buy Stories ads across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.
The company also stated that Marketplace ads are gaining traction. Facebook is working on making these ads more relevant.
In fact, across all its platforms and formats, Facebook is using artificial intelligence (AI) to make ads more relevant and effective. In the reported quarter, the company developed new AI ranking models that help people see ads they're more likely to be interested in.
AI is now used to identify and more quickly review ads that might breach Facebook's policies related to fake news and misinformation. It was effectively used during the U.S. midterm elections.
Operating Details
In the reported quarter, costs and expenses jumped 61.8% year over year to $9.09 billion.
Marketing & sales expenses jumped 79.5% from the year-ago quarter to $2.47 billion. Marketing & sales expenses as percentage of revenues increased 400 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 14.6%.
General & administrative expenses surged 42.3% to $976 million. General & administrative expenses as percentage of revenues increased 50 bps to 5.8%.
Research & development expenses jumped 46.5% to $2.86 billion. Research & development expenses as percentage of revenues increased 190 bps to 16.9%.
Notably, Facebook's employee base surged 42% year over year to 35,587. The company ended 2018 with more than 30,000 people working on safety and security, up from 10,000 people a couple of years ago.
Operating income of $7.82 billion grew 6.4% year over year. However, operating margin declined from 56.7% to 46.2%.
Balance Sheet & Cash Flow
As of Dec 31, 2018, cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities were $41.11 billion compared with $41.21 billion as of Sep 30, 2018.
Capital expenditures were $4.37 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office buildings. Free cash flow was $3.32 billion compared with $5.41 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Facebook bought back almost $3.5 billion of its Class A common stock in the reported quarter. In December, the company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of additional stock worth $9 billion.
Guidance
For the first quarter of 2019, total revenue growth rate is projected to decline mid-single digit percentage (on a constant currency basis) compared with the fourth-quarter growth rate.
Facebook also expects that revenue growth rates will continue to decline sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant-currency basis.
Moreover, 2019 total expenses will grow approximately 40-50% more than 2018. Capital expenditures outlook reiterated at $18-$20 billion, primarily due to continued large investment in building data centers.
Conclusion
Facebook report ed impressive fourth-quarter 2018 results, driven by solid ad revenues that benefited from impression growth on both Instagram Stories and Feed.
However, only Instagram Stories is now expected to be the key catalyst for impression growth in 2019. Moreover, Facebook needs to improve ad pricing to drive top-line growth. Further, Facebook's plan to introduce commerce in Instagram is expected to be a major growth driver.
Moreover, the company's plan to integrate messaging apps - WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger - is expected to take time (not before 2020). Zuckerberg believes that the integration will boost user experience by making the services more secure through end-to-end encryption.
However, uncertain microenvironment due to Brexit and the U.S. shutdown is a headwind. Additionally, continued mix shift toward Stories is expected to hurt ARPU. Moreover, aggressive investments into security and innovation on AR/VR and AI technologies are expected to negatively impact profits in 2019.

The Journal says five members of the agency met via videoconference yesterday, but while staffers are recommending an antitrust lawsuit, the commissioners have yet to decide and adjourned without taking action.

The FTC had listed the teleconference on its public calendar, but not what the topic of discussion would be, saying it was discussing a law enforcement matter that has not been made public.
Facebook is also being probed by the agency for possible abuse of its market position to squelch competition. The Journal says areas being investigated include its acquisition of other companies such as Instagram.
The current investigation has taken testimony from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, something the FTC hadn't done previously when it looked into the tech stock's failures on user privacy.
Instagram has grown massively popular, often because it borrowed some of the best ideas created by its rivals, such as Snap's (NYSE: SNAP) Stories feature on Snapchat, and more recently launched Reels to compete against TikTok. But the platform hasn't necessarily damaged the competition.
Even with TikTok possibly being banned in the U.S., it remains extremely popular. And Snap just reported a stunning surge in revenue for the second quarter that saw it earn adjusted profits of $56 million compared to a year-ago loss.
More recently, though, Facebook created a controversy by limiting the distribution on its platform of an article critical of former vice president Joe Biden, although the story had not broken any of its rules, leading to complaints about bias.
The Journal says an antitrust lawsuit could be filed by year's end.

1697171.0,2023-12-08 00:00:00 UTC,Meta Platforms Stock Has More Room To Run,OXSQZ,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-has-more-room-to-run,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
As Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) “year of efficiency” draws to a close, the technology company and its stock look stronger than ever. META stock has gained 154% on the year, making it a top performer among technology stocks and a big contributor to the Nasdaq index’s 36% increase in 2023.
The strong run over the past year represents a significant turnaround for Meta Platforms, which saw its stock fall 53% during the 2022 bear market and had analysts and investors questioning its plans to build a virtual world known as “the metaverse.” Now, as 2024 approaches, the company and its shareholders look well-positioned for continued growth.
META Stock and the Year of Efficiency
Meta Platforms began 2023 by announcing its plans to undertake a year of efficiency. The company had to cut metaverse spending and focus on AI projects. Better-managing costs also required Meta to layoff thousands of workers as the Facebook-parent company responded to Wall Street’s concerns about its spending and strategic direction.
The job cuts saw Meta reduce its headcount by over 15% globally. The company also lowered its total expenses in 2023 to $89 billion from a planned $100 billion and announced that its board of directors authorized a $40 billion increase to its stock buyback plan.
In 2022, the company bought back $27.9 billion of its own stock. Meta’s expenses increased by 22% to $25.8 billion in 2022, causing concern on Wall Street.
The reduced spending, staff reductions, and focus on shareholder returns were exactly what analysts and investors wanted from Meta Platforms and its stock has been steadily rising this year as a result.
AI Leadership and Products
Another big move by Meta Platforms this year that has won over investors and analysts was the company’s decision to refocus its efforts on AI and jump into the technology with both feet.
The company has done just that, announcing earlier this fall a new virtual reality headset that employs AI, as well as several AI applications at its most recent developer conference. Specifically, Meta unveiled several generative AI chatbots that look intriguing.
Meta’s “Emu” text-to-image platform will be integrated into its Messenger app, along with AI photo editing tools for Instagram.
Plus, Meta has said that it plans to make its own custom-made microchips to power its AI and video-processing platforms, and it has joined forces with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to launch a group of more than 50 other companies, research groups, and academics called the “AI Alliance” that will focus on advancing responsible AI projects.
The aggressive pivot to AI has caught the attention of investors and analysts who see Meta Platforms as a major player in the space and likely to benefit from AI’s advances in coming years.
Growth and Issues
All the changes undertaken this year are paying off for META stock. The company has issued a string of solid financial results throughout the year, and its recent third-quarter print was no exception.
Meta reported a 23% increase in its Q3 revenue as the market for online advertising at its social media sites rebounds following the pandemic. In fact, revenue in Q3 grew at the fastest rate in two years, boosting META stock. Earnings per share of $4.39 trounced the $3.63 that was expected on Wall Street.
Despite the strong results, Meta is not without problems. Much was made of the recent news that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sold $190 million of META stock in November of this year, his first sale of company stock in two years.
Also, the company is grappling with a lawsuit brought against it by 41 U.S. states whose attorney general’s accuse the company of intentionally addicting children to its social media platforms that include Instagram and knowingly hiding the harms that can be found online.
While not insignificant, the lawsuit will be resolved in time and is not likely to pose any near-term risks to Meta’s business or performance. As for the stock sale, almost all executives sell some of the equity they hold in a company from time-to-time. These sales are often scheduled far in advance and are not an indication of trouble or a lack of faith in a firm they manage.
META Stocks Is A Buy
As 2023 comes to an end, Meta Platforms looks to have righted its ship and positioned its business for future success. The company has reduced costs, become a major player in the red hot arena of AI, and continues to post impressive growth across its varied businesses. While it faces some headwinds, they don’t look like anything that is insurmountable and they shouldn’t stop the company’s long-term growth trajectory. Heading into 2024, META stock is a buy.

1362479.0,2018-04-23 00:00:00 UTC,Facebook Inc.'s In-House AI Chip Is Bad News for Intel Corp.'s Nervana,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/facebook-incs-house-ai-chip-bad-news-intel-corps-nervana-2018-04-23,,,"In 2016, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) acquired artificial intelligence chip start-up Nervana Systems. Nervana's technology was supposed to allow Intel to compete against graphics giant NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the market for processors that handle the training of neural networks.
According to Intel, Nervana's dedicated neural network training chips were slated to provide ""unprecedented compute density at an order of magnitude more computing power than today's state of the art [graphics processing units].""
Late last year, Intel announced that it would begin shipping its first Nervana Engine by the end of 2017 and that it was ""thrilled to have Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) in close collaboration sharing technical insights as we bring this new generation of new AI hardware to market.""
Just a few months later, Bloomberg reported that Facebook is working to develop its own hardware, likely for artificial intelligence and machine-learning workloads.
Here's why this could spell trouble for Intel's Nervana efforts.
Why build your own chips?
While a giant like Facebook can certainly afford the expense of building its own chips, the reality is that it's a non-trivial undertaking. Facebook isn't in the business of building and selling chips to customers -- it's interested in making sure that the vast data center infrastructure that supports its platforms is as efficient as possible to keep its total cost of operating as low as possible.
If a third-party company like, say, Intel is willing to do the work to build great solutions for this market (especially if it'd be hard to replicate the performance/efficiency of the third party solution), then it makes sense to simply use that third-party solution. Moreover, when there are many chip vendors vying to build the best solutions possible, a buyer like Facebook is usually in good shape in terms of hardware pricing, too, as competition naturally brings lower prices.
It generally makes sense for a company to build its own chips in the following scenarios:
A company thinks it can do a better job of building a product tailored to its own requirements than any third party could.
A company wants a chip developed to run proprietary algorithms/techniques that it doesn't want to share with a third party for competitive reasons.
Although it's conceivable that the second point is a key factor in driving Facebook to explore building its own chips, my guess -- based on the fact that Facebook gave Intel permission to name drop it in the Nervana chip press release last year -- is that it's more of the first one.
Indeed, if Intel's Nervana chip is under-performing relative to the company's lofty claims (something that Facebook developing its own chips has me wondering about), and if the other dedicated machine-learning chip start-ups (there are a lot of them out there these days) can't deliver either, then it wouldn't be surprising for Facebook to think that its best chance of getting the hardware it needs is to build that hardware itself.
Who wins, here?
Facebook may be designing its own chips, but it'll need a third party to manufacture them. While Intel has advertised chip manufacturing services of its own in the past, those efforts don't seem to have gained much traction.
I believe, then, that if Facebook is successful in deploying its own artificial intelligence/machine-learning chip, it'll likely tap contract chip manufacturing giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) to manufacture the chips (since TSMC's manufacturing technology is arguably the best in the industry, and its track record is superb).
Such orders wouldn't be a game changer for TSMC -- Facebook's order volumes for such a chip wouldn't be anywhere near those of, say, a mobile processor or even a merchant graphics processor -- but it'd be incremental revenue over the long term -- always a good thing.
